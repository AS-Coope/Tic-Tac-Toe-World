# Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe: World
What started as a final project in high school has now grown into an ernest effort to be an enjoyable and
while gaming experience.  

** The current game has issues when playing (specifically against the higher bosses in Story Mode)  
** However, Tournament Mode is working as it (at least from the time of design) should so you can enjoy with friends.  

# How to Play
Download and unzip the folder.  
Currently a .exe comes with the folder which you can open and run for ease of playing the game.  
Or you can use build the Tic-Tac-Toe World v(y.y.y) file and run it (where y.y.y represents the current version).  
** Please note, as aforementioned, some parts of the game is broken and will be fixed over the coming weeks  

# Outcome
The intent is to polish this game to better understand C, finish an idea I've had for years and become more efficient at programming. Then create a small game engine in C++ and recreate it using that.  

As such, over the following weeks the game will be updated until it reaches the final design I had in mind.
