# Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe: World
What started as a final project in high school has now grown into an ernest effort to be an enjoyable and
while gaming experience.  

** The current game has issues when playing (specifically against the higher bosses in Story Mode)  
** However, Tournament Mode is working as it (at least from the time of design) should so you can enjoy with friends.  
** IDE used was Codeblocks (despite there being a vscode folder here I haven't properly set it up so that is builds in VSCode using mingw)  

# How to Play
Download and unzip the folder.  
Currently a .exe comes with the folder which you can open and run for ease of playing the game.  
Or you can use build the Tic-Tac-Toe World v(y.y.y) file and run it (where y.y.y represents the current version).  
** Please note, as aforementioned, some parts of the game is broken and will be fixed over the coming weeks  

# Outcome
The intent is to polish this game to better understand C, finish an idea I've had for years and become more efficient at programming. Then create a small game engine in C++ and recreate it using that.  

As such, over the following weeks the game will be updated until it reaches the final design I had in mind.  

# Current Objectives
1. Figure out what causes errors and fix those issues.
2. Convert the one file into several files to organize the code (UI, Controller, Logic, Database).
3. Create folders to further organize code.
4. Redo the "AI".
